## Project Description:
The current project seeks to solve user difficulties associated with buying used clothes online. The target community is vast and includes all demographics who are seeking to buy used clothes. This could be young members of gen-z, older millennials, etc. These are likely people who are trying to engage in fashion and expand their wardrobe while being environmentally conscious. Based on user research these are the key features of the project.
1) Having pricing recommendations both on the selling side and buying side of user to user interactions. 

2) Having an interactive map that doubles as a search bar to find items close to you in order to mitigate shipping costs and the related environmental impact. 
Mandatory categories on items, quality control when selling items and a simple and intuitive design that is easy to navigate and control. 

3) The user persona can be a wide variety of people but I have chosen a 19 year old college age student. This is to highlight the price features of the app to ensure they are getting a fair price, as well as someone who is trying to save money in shipping fees. Another important component is their desire to lower their environmental impact.

#### Task 1: 
Find search bar from home screen, where to input information and where filters would be found.
This was very easy for the user, they were able to properly locate the filters and locate the search bar. Going back to the home screen was also very easy and intuitive for the user. They mentioned after the highlighted the section they were on in the bottom row helped them remember where they are in the app. The cart location was also clear to them as well as the function of each of the categories displayed. I wouldn't change much in terms of the basic functions of the app.

#### Task 2: 
How to find user’s profile and add a listing to your shop.
This was also quite easy for the user. They were able to identify the figurine in the bottom right hand corner as the profile section and properly list most of the functions on this screen. I noticed having icons that correspond to intended use is very helpful for users. Adding an item to the shop was also very easy, and being able to back out of this back to the shop page and the home page were also both very easy. The user’s interpretation of having the camera in the app was not as I intended. They said that it was for ease of use when in reality I meant for this as a step in the authentication process. I would add clarity not just in terms of the basic functions of the app, but why they exist in order to draw the user in and get them invested in our app. 

#### Task 3: 
How to find map with items, how to search for items and how to select and filter certain listings. 
The map section was also easy. I feel as if they were able to find the map specifically because I mentioned to them there was a map in the app. If i hadn’t said this I don’t think the user would have been able to identify the fact that the corresponding icon was indeed a map. I also don’t think the purpose of the map was clear to the user, who thought the icons were for sellers rather than listings as I intended. They were however able to clearly identify the filters and search bar on the map screen. The purpose of having a map on a re-selling app was also unclear to them (in the way that I had intended). 

### Reflection: 
The process was quite smooth, I just acted as if they were using the app and wanted to do basic things with it. I was worried that the user would be confused by the point of the activity and wouldn’t understand that they were interacting with an app or website in the form of paper, but this ended up not being the case. I don’t have too many things I would do differently when conducting the exercise but I would probably make a point of explaining the point of a lot of the different functions of the website: for example the map and the internal camera when listing items. On the other hand I also see the value of not doing this because when a traditional user interacts with the system they won’t have someone to explain things to them. This shows me that the point of each function in the app should be explained when first launched (for example a pop up screen explaining why each service exists). I didn’t expect the tasks to be difficult at all and this ended up being true. The user interface isn’t very different than any other ecommerce website/app. I did however learn that the app needs to do a better job showing why the specific ways it does things are superior to alternative options.
